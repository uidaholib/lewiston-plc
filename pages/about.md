## About this site

This curated digital collections comes from the <a href='https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/plcphotos/'>Potlatch Lumber Company Photograph Collection</a>, which is maintained by the <a href="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/">University of Idaho Library's Digital Initatives program</a>.

This site was made based on a request for a patron. We curated images of Lewiston and Nez Perce County from the collection and built a quick site for their use. The site is not discoverable via Google and meant to be used for educational purposes only. 

If you would like a high-resolution image from this collection, please contact libspec@uidaho.edu with your inquiry.
